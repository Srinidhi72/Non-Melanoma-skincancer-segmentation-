[Medical Image Analysis] Interpretable Deep Learning Systems for Multi-Class Segmentation and Classification of Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer


In an increasingly demanding environment for pathologists, it is expected that deep learning methods can serve to improve the efficiency of pathologist work-flows, such as in the case of diagnosing non-melanoma skin cancer.
This work applies interpretable deep learning methods which characterize the tissue by classifying it into 12 meaningful dermatological classes, including hair follicles, sweat glands as well as identifying the well-defined stratified layers of the skin and identifies what and where the cancer is in context.
These provide highly interpretable outputs as the network is trained to represent the problem domain in the same way a pathologist would.
Whole image classification is done by CNN classifier and other three machine learning classifiers such as Random Forest, KNN  by characterising the full context of the tissue by performing semantic segmentation using U-net architecture .
